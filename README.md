Linear Regression Models

Pursuing a different and diverse Machine Learning models and methods. Suggested is a project for implementation of a different linear regressors in different methods and algorithms. Comparing those models and impliementations with build-in models in librariessuch as sklearn and more.
Beside the different algorithms analytical calculations and implementations, applying an algebric closed-form solutions to the challenging data-set given.
In the project we're ploting and explaining the results with comparisons.

The project contains:

1. A standard Linear Regression algorithm
   * Closed-form algebric solution
   * Linear model via Gradient Descent algorithm
   * An sklearn Linear Regressor
   * Comparing between the different 3 models and it's affect on our data

2. A Ridge Linear Regression algorithm (with L2 Norm Regularization)
   * Closed-form algebric solution
   * Ridge linear model via Gradient Descent algorithm (Analytical\manual calculations)
   * An sklearn Ridge Linear Regressor
   * Comparing between the different 3 models and it's affect on our data
   * Ploting and explaining our results
